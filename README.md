Website that acts as a simple dating website that compares your results to the questions to others who chose similar answers.

Here is how the folders are setup for the website below:
Frien-dFinder
  - .gitignore
  - app
    - data
      - friends.js
    - public
      - home.html
      - survey.html
    - routing
      - apiRoutes.js
      - htmlRoutes.js
  - node_modules
  - package.json
  - server.js
  
  To get to function:
  1.) Download files
  2.) Run npm install to install node modules
  3.) run node server.js
  
  This website used API routes and node for this to function properly. (I had a lot of trouble with Heroku)
